objviewer
=========
objviewer is a file viewer for Wavefront's Advanced Visualizer [object files][1] (*.obj) written in Java. 
The viewer was part of a integrated computer graphics (ICG) course in my first term as a master student a
few years ago. The viewer uses a [winged edge][2] data structure for the parsed obj files.
