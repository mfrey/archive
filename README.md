## About
This repository contains mostly code I've written during my time as a undergraduate/graduate student.

## Projects
### objviewer
objviewer is a file viewer for Wavefront's Advanced Visualizer object files (*.obj) written in Java. The viewer was part of a integrated computer graphics (ICG) course in my first term as a master student in the summer of 2009. The viewer uses a [winged edge data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_edge) for the obj files.
### pandora
pandora was the attempt to come up with a simple simulation of routing algorithms based on the ant-colony optimization heuristic. I've did the project before I was aware of discrete event simulators and it was a mere project to toy around with R a bit. I can't recommend to use R for anything else than statistics (and probably for machine learning).
### pandora analysis
This project provides a set of bash and R scripts for generating and plotting data. The scripts target mainly data which was partially generated by the pandora project.
