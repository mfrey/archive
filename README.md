## About
This repository contains mostly code I've written during my time as a undergraduate/graduate student.

## Projects
### objviewer
objviewer is a file viewer for Wavefront's Advanced Visualizer object files (*.obj) written in Java. The viewer was part of a integrated computer graphics (ICG) course in my first term as a master student in the summer of 2009. The viewer uses a [winged edge data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_edge) for the obj files.
